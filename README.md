# PHP Exercises for algorithms

This repository will contain a series of exercises designed to train algorithms and various other skills in PHP and see your progress through a simple graphical interface.
To start, use `php -S localhost:8000 -t public` in the root folder of this project.

## Archeology

### Mural

Trains : string manipulation, logical thinking

In this exercise, an encrypted message will be displayed (and how exactly it was encrypted), and you will have to write the required algorithms to decrypt that message.

## Garden

### Planter

Trains : manipulating one dimensional arrays, using common array methods.

In the planter exercise, you will get a planter (single-dimension array) and a pot (one-character string) and will need to manipulate them to reproduce the results given in the instructions.

### Field

Trains : nested loops, conditions

In this exercise, you will be provided with a short description and an image of what the garden is expected to look like, and you will have to write the code to make it happen.
